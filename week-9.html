                This week I worked on connecting my Huzzah and Metro M0 Express 
                boards using a wired connection in order to control a TFT board
                 using a WiFi connection!

            <h2>Connecting the Boards Using a Wired Connection</h2> 

            <p class="lead">
                This <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Networking/networking/digital_io/index.html">tutorial</a> shows that it is pretty simple 
                to make two boards communicate with one another. It did take me a little longer than expected though, 
                as I was trying to figure out the best way to connect the boards, how to make sure they shared 
                the same ground, and how to power both boards. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Here is how I decided to connect my boards:
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                <ol>
                    <li>I had to figure out which board was the receiving board and 
                        which one was the transmitting board. Since the remote server 
                        is sending the signal to the Huzzah which sends an output signal 
                        to the Metro M0 Express Board to change the TFT display, I realized 
                        that the Huzzah is the transmitting board and the Metro M0 Express is 
                        the receiving board.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now I had to make sure that the correct output pin on the Huzzah corresponded 
                        with the input pin on the Metro and that the code shows the correct pins. 
                        On the Huzzah, I made the output pin A5/4 and connected this to the input 
                        pin 12 on the Metro board. See this <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/pinouts">link</a>
                        for the pinouts on the Huzzah.
                    </li>

                    <img class="img-fluid" width="500" height="600" src="assets/img/receive.jpg">

                    <li>
                        In order to connect the two grounds, I added a wire between the 
                        second GND pin on the Metro board and the negative terminal 
                        on the breadboard connecting to GND on the Huzzah.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, I used the DC Jack on the Metro board to connect the board 
                        to power and used my laptop and USB to power the Huzzah.
                    </li>

            <h2>Writing the Arduino Scripts for Both Boards</h2>

            <p class="lead">
                Working from the same <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Networking/networking/digital_io/index.html">link</a>, 
                I was able to write code for the transmitting board (Huzzah) and the receiving board (Metro) 
                based on the pins I came up with and previously working with the TFT display board, 
                a Huzzah, and the remote Firebase server. I decided to use the same server that 
                I created in class used to control an LED remotely, except now when the LED turns on, 
                I also want to turn on the TFT display as well.

            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                <a href='assets/transmit.ino' download>Code</a> for the transmitting board (Huzzah):
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                <a href='assets/receive.ino' download>Code</a> for the receiving board (Metro):
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                I used a hotspot on my iPhone in order to connect to the remote server, 
                so you can input any home or public WiFi or hotspot that your computer 
                or device is also connected to as the WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD input. 
                See this <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/10_networking/huzzah1b.html">Firebase tutorial</a> 
                for more information on obtaining your FIREBASE_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH names.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Remote Server</h2>

            <p class="lead">
                Access my remote server <a href='./week-9-fb.html'>here</a>! Now when my Huzzah, Metro, LED and 
                TFT display are all powered and connected to my iPhone's hotspot, you will be able to control my
                devices from anywhere using the remote server!
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Future Work</h2>

            <p class="lead">
                The inspiration for this project was to be able to have someone write 
                words over the remote server to print on the board, but since 
                I was dealing with <code>digitalRead()</code> and <code>digitalWrite()</code> functions 
                with only deal with HIGH and LOW inputs and outputs, I was not 
                able to explore how to get past this binary constraint this week. 
                However, it would be really cool to keep working more with these 
                devices in the future to eventually allow someone to print words 
                on the display remotely! Another idea could be for someone to 
                enter a number on the remote server, and the LED could flash 
                that many times while the display prints the number.
