            <p class="lead">This week we learned about molding and casting! 
                I molded my <a href="https://jessie9111.github.io/PHYSCI-70/week-5.html">3D modeled head from week 5</a> 
                and a small tire in order to create cool ice sculptures.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">I followed this <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/09_casting/casting.html">tutorial</a> and 
                collected <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/sorta-clear-37/">Sorta-Clear 37 (Parts A and B)</a>, stir stick, 
                vinyl gloves, safety glasses, pattern to mold, water as a casting medium (can also use chocolate, butter, 
                jell-o, wax, plaster, bizmuth-tin, etc.), plastic cups, chopsticks, and scissors.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">I decided to cast my 3D modeled head and a tire and poured about 3 ounces total 
                (1.5 for parts A and B) in each cup, mixing part B first then pouring part A.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Both objects did not float or sink, so I played around with the 
                objects to place them in a way that would make it easier to remove them later. 
                The tire was easy to place into the mixture, 
                but I wasn’t sure which orientation to place the head at first (face down, 
                face up or sideways). I ended up placing the head sideways to be able to 
                create a mold of the entire shape, but I didn’t submerge it entirely so that 
                it would be easier to remove once the mold cured.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">I placed the mold by the window and allowed it to cure for about a day. 
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" width="500" height="500" src="assets/img/12-objects.jpg">

            <p class="lead">It was a little difficult to remove both of the objects. For the tire, 
                I used a chopstick to poke around the tire and slowly pull it out until 
                I was able to poke at it enough to be able to remove it.  
            </p>
            <p class="lead">For the head, I tried poking around but wasn’t as successful 
                particularly because the part of the head that wasn’t submerged was still 
                covered with silicone. I ended up using scissors to cut along the side of 
                the head and slowly remove the 3D model from the mold.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Here are my molds!

            <p class="lead">For the casting medium, I poured water in the molds and left them in the freezer overnight.

            <p class="lead">The next morning, I removed my ice sculptures from the mold pretty easily and got two beautiful ice sculptures!

            <p class="lead">I had a lot of fun trying out molding and casting and would love to try out various object to mold
                and different casting mediums (especially chocolate YUM!) in the future!
