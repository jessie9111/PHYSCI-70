                This week we learned about sensors, and I made two sensors. 
                The first sensor uses capacitance to measure a physical quantity, and the
                second sensor is a microphone used to measure amplitude or loudness. 
                I used the serial monitor and plotter in the Arduino IDE in order 
                to calibrate each sensor and visualize the data.
            </p>

            <h2>Capacitive Sensor</h2>

            <p class="lead">
                My goal for this sensor was to create a tool that was able to measure physical
                quantities. In this case, I wanted to measure chocolate pieces! I'm not really
                a snack person so I still have a lot of leftover truffles from Valentine's Day,
                but I don't want my roommates to steal them! I decided to build a contraption that
                would measure whether or not some chocolates had been removed from the cup.
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" width="405" height="360" src="assets/img/chocolates.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                My first step was wiring the capacitive sensor. Using the steps we learned in class,
                I created the following capacitive-based sensor by attaching two copper electrodes 
                (tape on circuitboard material) to wire attached with two 1M ohm resistors to make
                the signal stabler. I expect for the signal to increase when there is more force between the
                two copper plates, or when there is more chocolate in the cup!
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Here is the image of the wiring for the capacitive sensor. One side of one resistor
                goes to GND, and the other end goes to 3.3V. Then one wire connects where the two
                resistors meet to the analog A0 pin, which is also in the same row as the wire connected to 
                one of the copper plates. Finally, the second copper plate is connected to digital pin 4.
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" width="405" height="360" src="assets/img/capacitive.jpg">
            
            <p class="lead">
                Now that my sensor is wired, I'm ready to start building my truffle detector! I simply 
                taped the copper plates to the cup, applying the tape so the copper part was facing inwards towards
                the cup.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                After learning more about capacitance, I decided to first calibrate my sensors using water.
                I first measured the values given an empty cup, and then measured the values given a full
                cup and a half filled cup of water. 
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                I used code from <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/tx_rx_sensors/">Robert Hart's website</a>
                to program my capacitive sensor to transmit-receive across space between two resistors.

            <p class="lead">I then made some plots using the Arduino IDE (Tools > Serial Plotter) 
                in order to see the various values at the different settings.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The measured values of the empty cup ranged from about 18000 to 21000. We can say that the average
                value when the cup is empty is about 19500 and use this value as a baseline for our future values once 
                the cup is filled.
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/empty_cup.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                The measured value of a half-filled water cup is about 309000, so significantly more than an empty cup.
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/half_cup.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                The measured values of a full water cup is about 314000, so slightly more than a half-filled cup.
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/full_cup.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                I then emptied the cup again and found that the measurements were slightly different than those that
                I got when I first measured the sensor values using the empty cup, it seems like capacitive sensors
                can be very sensitive!
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/empty_cup_2.png">

            <p class="lead">
                Now that I'm familar with the values and can use my original value of about 19500 as a baseline, 
                we can measure chocolate in the cup. My goal is to figure out if some chocolate pieces have been 
                removed from the cup. This sensor is suitable for this goal because I don't need to know exactly 
                how many pieces have been taken, I just want to know if the cup is full or has less chocolate than
                the expected 20 pieces.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                Here are the measured values when all 20 pieces of chocolate are in the cup. I get an average value
                in the 27000 to 28500 range.
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/chocolate_full.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                I wondered, what if someone takes one piece of chocolate? It didn't look like there was much change in
                the capacitance value, which ranged around 27000 to 28000 when the cup held 19 truffles. 
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/chocolate_almost_full.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                What if I removed 5 pieces, leaving only 15 in the cup? It looks like there's a slight drop in value!
                Now the value averages about 26000. Now I'll know if someone steals a few of my chocolates!
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/chocolate_15.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                Let's try removing more pieces so that the cup is half full (10 pieces left). Most values are around
                24000:

            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/chocolate_half_full.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                Here's the reading at five chocolate pieces which averages around 22000:
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="assets/img/chocolate_5.jpg">

            <p class="lead">
                Everytime I removed five pieces, there was a significant drop in the capacitance value.
                Looks like the sensor is working well and can detect if a 
                few pieces are taken from the jar! Now I’ll know next time my roommates 
                try messing with my chocolate...

            <h2>Microphone Sensor</h2>

            <p class="lead">
                Wiring the <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/06_input/MEMSmic.html">microphone</a>
                was pretty straightforward! The SPW2430 board uses an analog MEMS microphone and is 
                fairly simple to hook up. I connected GND to GND, Vin to 3.3V, 
                and the analog audio waveform comes out of the DC pin so I have the DC pin
                connected pin A1 on the Metro M0 Express board.
